Kolderie, with mixing by Scott Litt and J Mascis.\n It was Hole's only album to feature bassist Kristen Pfaff before her death in June 1994.\n In 2013, Schemel joined the indie rock group Upset, formed by Ali Koehler, previously of Vivian Girls and Best Coast.\n It was released by DGC Records on April 12, 1994, just one week after frontwoman Courtney Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, died in their home."

Anaerobic phototrophic bacteria, on the contrary, can contain numerous species of photosynthetic pigments like bacteriochlorophyll a, b, c, d, e, f, etc."
